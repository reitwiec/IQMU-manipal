                The International Quiz for Medical Undergraduates, IQMU, is a student-run initiative hosted by Kasturba
                Medical College, Manipal, a name synonymous with quality medical education, as proven by its consistent
                ranking amongst the top 10 medical colleges in the country over the years.
                <br>
                <br>

                IQMU was conceived from the experience and inspiration gathered by a team of students who attended a
                similar international competition – CICoM, in Mexico, in the year 2016. Upon their return to Manipal,
                their stories ignited a spark in their fellow peers to create an event which strives to facilitate
                international academic and cultural exchange, and thus IQMU made its debut in 2017 with the continuous
                support of our sponsor, GEMx.
