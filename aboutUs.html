                            The International Quiz for Medical Undergraduates, IQMU, is a student-run initiative hosted
                            by
                            Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, a name synonymous with quality medical education, as
                            proven by
                            its consistent ranking amongst the top 10 medical colleges in the country over the years.
                            KMC Manipal
                            is a constituent of Manipal Academy of Higher Education, a world-class institution sprawled
                            over 600
                            acres in Karnataka, India. <br> <br>
                            IQMU was conceived from the experience and inspiration gathered by a team of students who
                            attended a similar international competition – CICoM, in Mexico, in the year 2016. Upon
                            their return
                            to Manipal, their stories ignited a spark in their fellow peers to create an event which
                            strives to
                            facilitate international academic and cultural exchange, and thus IQMU made its debut in
                            2017 with
                            the continuous support of our sponsor, GEMx. <br> <br>
                            The quiz consists rounds which tests the participants&#39; knowledge and understanding in
                            the fields of
                            basic medical sciences such anatomy, physiology, pathology and pharmacology, and core
                            medical
                            subjects such as medicine, surgery and obstetrics. The rounds vary far and wide in their
                            formats,
                            ranging from spotters and clinical vignettes, written question papers comprising of
                            multiple-choice
                            questions, matrices and comprehensive passages, to IQMU&#39;s acclaimed Mental Relay, which
                            provides
                            participants with a clinical case scenario that must be solved by ordering from a set panel
                            of
                            investigations that would lead to diagnosis, in a relay fashion, as would be in a hospital
                            setting. <br> <br>
                            IQMU is thus an amazing opportunity for medical students worldwide to experience the best
                            possible
                            3-day quest comprising of an extensive, nail-biting quiz, informative workshops, programs
                            showcasing the rich culture of India, clinical and medical learning and most importantly,
                            interaction
                            and exchange with other medical students of different backgrounds from around the world!

                            a barren
                            hill with few trees, it was transformed into a teeming university town by Dr. T. M. A Pai,
                            who first
                            founded Kasturba Medical College in 1953, the flagship institute of the Manipal Academy of

                            free-spirited
                            minds and the bustle of ever-busy Manipal students.
